Bachelor in Electrical Engineering, experience as docent and industrial development projects, from draftsman to project manager, in recent years I have been developing a family gastronomic venture and specializing in programming, data science, and the development of financial investment and algorithmic trading strategies. Recently i am working on Fianacial Analisis calculators. I firmly believe that perseverance in study and continuous work are the keys to success in everything i set out to do and that's how I live the day to day.
